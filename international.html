      <h3>International</h3>

      <p>23 countries. 1 message. The challenge to communicate Apple in a way that most resonates in all these markets yet stays truly Apple was a complicated yet rewarding process. After 7 years at Media Arts Lab, I’ve created hundreds of spots by leading local teams around the world. I helped to maintain the message, tone, and intention while crafting them to be as local and authentic as possible. Here are some highlights.</p>

      <br>

      <h3 id="apple-intentions">Apple Intentions</h3>

      <p>Adapted Apple’s “Intentions” digital spot for Japan, China, Korea, French Canada, and Australia. It was a very personal message from Apple about what they stand for. Adapting this spot was quite a challenge as every word was chosen after much deliberation and we had to make sure we conveyed a message that was just as genuine. Also had to make sure the wordplay and animation could work together.</p>

      <h3 id="iphone-6">iPhone 6 Launch</h3>

      <p>Adapted Apple’s iPhone 6 launch campaign for all our Asian, Canadian, Australia, New Zealand markets. We had to find the perfect two VO talents to be able to give a sense of humor and friendliness to the two new iPhones. Casted and wrote new scripts with relevant jokes for all of our 23 markets as the humor was quite different country to country.</p>

      <h3 id="iphone-6s">iPhone 6S</h3>

      <p>This fast-paced piece didn’t leave much room for dialogue so we had to edit and rewrite parts of the US spots for international markets in a way that made sense, fit all the information within, yet didn’t sound like a train-wreck.</p>
